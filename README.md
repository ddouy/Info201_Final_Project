# Info201_Final_Project

This is the README for the final project for INFO 201. Collaboration partners include SangHo Bak Yao Dou, Jeffrey Jing, and David Lee. 

Our final product will be in the form of an interactive Shiny based application. For this project, we intend to utilize publicly available data on the stock market's S&P 505 in order to allow users to compare how well two companies have been doing financially over the past five years. 

For those who don't know, the S&P 505 includes 505 of the stock market's top 505 companies.
